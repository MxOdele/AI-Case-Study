## Overview and Origin

### *Name of organization*

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (<a href='https://www.finra.org/#/' title='FINRA website'>FINRA</a>)

### *When was FINRA founded?*

30 July, 2007

### *How was FINRA founded?*

As per their 2007 News Release;

>"FINRA was created through the consolidation of NASD and the member regulation, enforcement and arbitration operations of the New York Stock Exchange."[^1]

While the consolodation was announced on 28 November, 2006, it was not approved by the Securities and Exchange Commision (<a href='https://www.sec.gov/' title='SEC website'>SEC</a>) until 26 July, 2007.

### *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*

Finra was formed as the result of the regulatory boards for the National Association of Securities Dealers (NSAD) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) consolodating their member firm regulations operations into a single organizaiton, FINRA. Per SEC approval, the merge 

> "...included a FINRA Board governance structure that balanced public and industry representation."[^2]

### *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*

With a reported 2023 budget of **$1.158 billion**, FINRA mostly relies on industry fees assessed to member firms and brokers for its operating revenue. Additional funds are received through member and user fees (such as qualification and registration fees) and interest and dividends earned through company assets.[^3]

## Business Activities

### *What specific purpose is the company fulfilling?*

FINRA oversees broker-dealers and brokerage firms to protect investors, and to ensure the U.S. financial market's fair and honest operation. To help participants in the market trade with confidence, the regulations FINRA puts into place require standards such as;

+ Ensuring the basic protections investors deserve
+ Requiring those that sell securities products to be tested, qualified, and licensed
+ Requiring securities product advertisements to be honest and nont misleading
+ Selling securities products only suitable to an investor's needs
+ Providing a complete disclosure for any investment product to the investor prior to purchase

This oversight is authorized by Congress.[^4]

### *Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*

While their goal is to protect investors, **FINRA oversees nearly 625,000 brokers** in the U.S.[^4] Under SEC supervision, FINRA:

+ writes and enforces rules for the ethical practices of all registers brokers and brokerage firms
+ examines member firms for compliance
+ pushes for market transparancy
+ provides education for investors[^5]

### *Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?*

> "FINRA uses cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, cloud computing and big data analytics to protect investors and ensure market integrity."[^6]

With a potential **600 billion transactions a day** to process, FINRA has turned to the use of a variety of survellance algorithms to monitor for market manipulation, insider trading, and other attempts to gain an unfair advantage in the stock and bond market.[^6] Additionally, FINRA offers tools to investors (such as <a href='https://brokercheck.finra.org/' title='BrokerCheck by FINRA'>BrokerCheck</a>) and brokers, alike.

Among the assets FINA shares with brokers are a suit of development tools through their API Development Center. Through the use of the API Console App, and using the API Platform, FINRA provides the tools necessary for developers to create automated compliance solutions. These tools allow for both the improvement of overall risk management and a lower regulatory cost.[^7]

## Landscape

### *What field is the company in?*

Financial Regulation (specifically brokers and brokerage firms in the U.S[^4]) and FinTech

### *What have been the focus for trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?*

FinTech on the whole has seen a marked shift in focus towards automation and AI projects, in addition to technologies such as blockchain and cloud computing. Given that AI can interract with other digital technologies, many brokerage firms are working with AI to:

+ Offer a better experience to their customers
+ Manage risk by leveraging their customers' financial hisotries to inform decisions
+ Detect fraud more rapidly and reliably
+ Adhere to regulations and compliance standards
+ Enhance security and cybersecurity[^8]

### *What are the other major companies in this field?*

Other Financial Regulatory bodies in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the:

+ SEC
+ Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href='https://www.cftc.gov/' title='CFTC website'>CFTC</a>)
+ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<a href='https://www.fdic.gov/' title='FDIC website'>FDIC</a>)
+ Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href='https://www.consumerfinance.gov/' title='CFPB website'>CFPB</a>)

## Results

### *What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

According to their reporting, in 2023, alone, FINRA had the following impacts on the U.S. financial market:

> + "Brought 610 disciplinary actions against registered brokers and firms for unethical behavior.
> + Levied $88.4 million in fines.
> + Ordered $7.5 million in restitution to harmed investors.

## Recommendations

### *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?*

I would suggest that FINRA offer a more direct compliance audit and review solution in the form of an AI driven tool.

### *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*

While their API Development Center provides the code and resources for individual brokers and firms to build their own such tools in an effort to lower regulation costs, this leaves a critical component to their mission still largely outside their own purview. The onus on the brokers and firms to both meet the standards of FINRA compliance, as well as construct the tool to ensure that they are meeting those same standards.

By constructing that same tool in-house, and maintaining control over its development, deployment, and support, FINRA would have the ability to standardize this tool to their own regulations. Additionally, as markets and needs change in real time, it would afford FINRA a single platform to roll out updates to the **more than 624,000 brokers**[^4] they oversee through a single channel.

### *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*

This solution would largely revolve around AI, and all the associated techologies required to develop and deploy it on such a large scale:

+ Data analytics
+ Natural language processing
+ Cloud computing
+ Security technologies
+ More...

### *Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*

The goal would be to develop a tool that would be powerful enough to monitor hundreds of thousands of brokers, flexible enough to adjust with changing regulations, and efficient enough to incentivize use by all FINRA members. These technologies, when leveraged together under the umbrella of AI, would enable this compliance audit and review tool. Through that, FINRA would better be able to regulate the U.S. financial market.
